## About

This project aims to **predict the risk of brain stroke** using machine learning techniques. It uses a dataset that includes a variety of medical and lifestyle factors to assess stroke probability with high accuracy.

The goal is to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early detection, potentially saving lives through timely intervention.

> Built with robust ML algorithms and evaluated to achieve up to **96% accuracy** (based on experimentation).

|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| gender           | Male/Female                          |
| age              | Patient age                          |
| hypertension     | 0/1 indicates hypertension           |
| heart_disease    | 0/1 indicates heart condition        |
| ever_married     | Marital status                       |
| work_type        | Job type                             |
| Residence_type   | Urban/Rural                          |
| avg_glucose_level| Average blood glucose                |
| bmi              | Body Mass Index                      |
| smoking_status   | Current/former/never                 |
| stroke (Target)  | 0 = No Stroke, 1 = Stroke            |

---

## Run / Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook Brain_Stroke.ipynb
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run Web App (If app.py exists)

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Model Overview (High Level)

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categories)  
- Feature scaling and class balancing  
- Model training using ML algorithms  
- Performance comparison and final model selection  
- Evaluation with metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision/Recall
  - Confusion Matrix

---

## Retrain / Rebuild

1. Download the dataset and place in `data/`  
2. Open the notebook and run all cells  
3. Save the final trained model  
4. Integrate with `app.py` if deploying

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| ModuleNotFoundError | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Data path error | Ensure `stroke.csv` is in `/data/` folder |
| Low accuracy | Tune model hyperparameters |
